    "# Task 2: Image Compression: SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "In image transforms you studied about diagonalisation. SVD decomposition works in similar way and decomposes your image $I = USV^*$, in case of I being a square matrix of size $mxm$, $S$ results into a diagonal matrix of size $mxm$ with its diagonal entries called as the singular values. Now consider writing $U = [u_1, u_2, ..., u_m]$, $V^* = [v_1; v_2; ...; v_m]$, and $S = diag(s_1, s_2, ..., s_m)$. Here $u_i$ are the columns of $U$, $v_i$ are the rows of $V^*$, and $s_i$ are the diagonal entries of $S$. Then you can re write $I$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I = \\sum_i^m s_i*matrix\\_dot(u_i, v_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider arranging $s_i$ into a decreasing order. You will find that mostly $s_m << s_0$. So, we can use this to smartly compress the original by only using the first k singular values. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "I_{compressed} = \\sum_i^k s_i*matrix\\_dot(u_i, v_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the difference originally you need $O(n^2)$ space but now you need only $O(kn)$ space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your task:\n",
    "In this you will write a program, which will compress the original image using SVD decomposition at a given k value and will then compare the compressed images with the original image using **SSIM** and **MSE** metrics. You can use skimage module for these metrics, refer [this](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/transform/plot_ssim.html).\n",
